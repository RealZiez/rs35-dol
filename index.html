                        <p>We as humans are naturally social creatures. In the past, humans relied on eachother to survive. Now, humans rely on each other for comfort and collaboration. Both these aspects require communication skills between humans in the form of language. It is our responsiblity that when we communicate to others that we remain honest and transparent, as it can be a matter of survival or maintaining relations. In addition, many of us were raised to speak properly and honestly to others. Both thes aspects reflect why communication & language are key to maintaining integrity</p>

                <div class="feature col">
                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Importance of Conscience</h3>
                    <p>From our very birth, our mind has an internal censor to regulate our conduct, this is guilt. The Catholic Church may refer to this as a voice from God or a law inscribed in our hearts by God that tells us right from wrong. This internal voice reminds us that even if we do have agency, we should still strive to do what is right. Overall, our conscience is important in maintaining our integrity, and is also the foundation for building our integrity.</p>

                    <h3 class="fs-2 text-body-emphasis">Importance of the Development of One's Conscience</h3>
                    <p>While we are born to have the ability to feel guilt, if it is not developed it will remain weak and can even be suppressed. Which is why the development of one's conscience can help us maintain integrity. In our childhood, we are raised by a fear of punishment or loss of love from our guardians. We develop our character according to the customs of our environments. This teaches us the ethics and morality of the community, informing our conscience between what is considered right from wrong.</p>

Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, sounds in his heart at the right moment. . . . For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. . . . His conscience is man's most secret core and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths."</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">This is an example of "The Importance of Conscience" from <a class="alt-link" href="https://sites.google.com/learn.cssd.ab.ca/rsromancatholic35-v2-summer24/unit-1-critical-ethical-and-moral-thinking/1-3-0-conscience-self-in-search-of-the-good/1-3-6-conscience-self-in-search-of-the-good">Lesson 1.3.6</a> which tells us that from our very birth, we have a basic sense of morality. This source reminds us that even from the very beginning, God is there to help and develop us to become the best version of ourselves. This early sense of morality helps us attain a sense of integrity early in our lives.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-3">Moral conscience, present at the heart of the person, enjoins him at the appropriate moment to do good and to avoid evil. It also judges particular choices, approving those that are good and denouncing those that are evil. It bears witness to the authority of truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human person is drawn, and it welcomes the commandments. When he listens to his conscience, the prudent man can hear God speaking.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Once again, this paragraph stems from <a class="alt-link" href="https://sites.google.com/learn.cssd.ab.ca/rsromancatholic35-v2-summer24/unit-1-critical-ethical-and-moral-thinking/1-3-0-conscience-self-in-search-of-the-good/1-3-6-conscience-self-in-search-of-the-good">Lesson 1.3.6</a>. This example in particular speaks of the human freedom of Agency. According to the Church, God gifted us with the freedom of autonomy, also known as Agency. We are able to decide what we do, however, God call us to be responsible with this gift. The way we treat ourselves and others, is also how we are treating God, which is why we are told by our conscience to act with integrity.</p>

                <p>(Romans 12:2)</p>
                <p>This passage reminds believers to not be the same as others. It tells us that we should instead let God change us, to become our true selves, additionally calling us to live a righteous life - one that is free of sin. This is a callback to the internal voice in our conscience that directs our ethics and morality.</p>

He had the strive to "pierce the heavens" just as Kamina did, but this feeling had laid dorment up until the passing of Kamina, it was at that moment when he realized his responsiblity and took up the mantle of Kamina.</p>

                    <p>Early in my Grade 9 year, I noticed that my friend group was slowly transitioning into a troublesome bunch, often staying out late, hanging out with the wrong people, and just doing things that students their age should not be doing. I was conflicted, my conscience told me that I could never fit into their group anymore, but at the same time I did not want to separate from my long time friends. I moved out shortly after my revelation, which gave me an opportunity to separate from my friends. Additionally, I confronted my friends and told them about how I feel like I did not fit in anymore. Thankfully they understood and let me go on my own. This experience taught me the importance of showing integrity to others and listening to your conscience.</p>
